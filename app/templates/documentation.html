<h3>Browse</h3> 
<p>Search the Roundup Orthology Database for orthologs between a Primary Genome and any of several other Genomes.  The results can be restricted to a set of Sequence Ids of interest.</p> 
<p><b>Parameters</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<a id="primary_genome"></a><br /> 
<b>Primary Genome</b> 
<p>Required.  Search results must contain a gene from this genome to be returned.</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<a id="identifier_type"></a><br /> 
<b>Identifier Type</b> 
<p>Search results may be filtered so that they must contain a sequence matching an identifier.  An identifier may be either Gene Name or Sequence Id.  An example of a gene name is aatA1.  An example of a sequence id is the NCBI GI Number 18402218.</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<a id="identifier"></a><br /> 
<b>Identifier</b> 
<p>Optional.  After selecting the appropriate Identifier Type, an identifier of the selected type may be entered.  Search results will be filtered so that only results containing sequences from the Primary Genome matching the identifier will be returned.  If this field is left blank, all results will be returned.  If Sequence Id is chosen as the Identifier Type then more than one identifier may be entered.  Separate each identifier with a space.</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<a id="secondary_genomes"></a><br /> 
<b>Secondary Genomes</b> 
<p>At least one is required.  Search results are filtered so that they contain one of the genomes selected (in addition to the Primary Genome selected.)</p>

<h3>Retrieve Phylogenetic Profiles</h3> 
<div id="doctext">Retrieve all phylogenetic profiles for a set of organisms.
    Phylogenetic profiles are <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(graph_theory)">connected
        components</a> whose nodes are proteins from the genomes selected and
    whose edges represent an orthologous relationship computed by the reciprocal smallest distance (RSD) algorithm.</div> 
<p><b>Parameters</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><a id="genomes"></a><br /> 
<b>Genomes</b></p> 
<p>Two or more required.  Orthologs for all pairwise combinations of the Genomes selected are retrieved.</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p><a id="tc_only"></a><br /> 
<b>Only Show Transitively Closed Phylogenetic Profiles</b></p> 
<p>If checked, only phylogenetic profiles where every protein is orthologous to every other protein are reported.  (These are the transitively closed subgraphs.)</p>

<h3>Ortholog Text Format</h3>
<p>
Inspired by the easy to parse <a href="http://web.expasy.org/docs/userman.html">Uniprot dat
    file format</a>, a text file containing serialized
orthologs starts with a parameters row, continues with 0 or more ortholog rows, 
then has an end row.  A parameter row starts with 'PA', then contains the
query genome taxon id, subject genome taxon id, divergence thresold, and e-value threshold used
to generate the orthologs.  An ortholog row starts with 'OR' and contains the id of the sequence
from the query genome, the id of the sequence from the subject genome, and the
maximum likelihood distance between the sequences.  An end row only contains
'//'.  All the values of parameter and ortholog rows are tab separated. 
</p>
<p>
A pair of genomes with no orthologs (which does happen on
rare occasions), would only have a parameter row and end row.  If a file
contains orthologs for
multiple pairs of genomes or multiple sets of parameters, The parameter row for
the next set of orthologs follows the end row of the previous set of orthologs.
It is easy to write a streaming, ad-hoc parser for this format.  Or

if you would like a parser written in Python.

<p>
Example snippet:
<pre>
PA      377629  553174  0.2     1e-20
OR      C5BPU7  D9RR02  1.4127
OR      C5BKE0  D9RR03  2.1041
//
PA      502025  521010  0.2     1e-20
//
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The terms 'query genome' and 'subject genome' come from the RSD algorithm used
to compute orthologs.  Since RSD is a reciprocal algorithm, it does not matter
which genome in a pair of genomes is the query and which is the subject; the
orthologs inferred are the same either way.  It only matters as a way of
keeping track of which column in the text file contains sequence identifiers
for which genome.  Given a pair of genomes, like human (9606) and mouse
(10090), we arbitrarily choose one to be the query genome and the other be the
subject genome based on lexicographic order.  Therefore, 10090 would be the
query genome and 9606 would be the subject genome.  In order to find all
orthologs for human in a ortholog text format file with many pairs of genomes,
you would need to search for 9606 in the subject and the query positions of the
PA rows.

<h3>Download Raw Data</h3> 
<p>Download orthologs for a pair of genomes, choosing the parameters of the
Reciprocal Smallest Distance (RSD) algorithm used to generate the data.
Orthologs can be downloaded in 
<a href="{% url 'home.views.documentation' %}#orthtextformat">text</a> or <a href="http://seqxml.org/xml/Main.html">OrthoXML</a> format.  Raw data contains one row for every ortholog.  Each row contains 3 tab-separated values: the gene sequence id from the First Genome, the gene sequence id from Second Genome, and the maximum likelihood estimation of evolutionary distance between those genes.  For more user-friendly results, consider using the Browse or Retrieve Phylogenetic Profiles queries.</p> 
<p><b>Parameters</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><a id="first_genome"></a><br /> 
<b>First Genome</b></p> 
<p>Required.  Return orthologs between this genome and Second Genome.</p> 
</li>

<a id="second_genome"></a><br /> 
<b>Second Genome</b>

</ul> 

<p><a id="search_gene_names"></a></p> 
<h3>Search For Gene Names</h3> 
<p>Search the list of gene names in Roundup.  This is the same list that is used when running a Browse query or when Browse and Retrieve results are reported with gene names.  Searching for gene names is a useful way to find a gene name with which to limit results when using the Browse query.  Using Search For Gene Names, one can find gene names which either <b>contain</b>, <b>start with</b>, <b>end with</b>, or are exactly <b>equal</b> to a given <b>query string</b>.</p> 
<p>After pressing Submit, any matching gene names in Roundup will be displayed.</p> 
<p><b>Parameters</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<a id="search_type"></a><br /> 
<b>Search Type</b> 
<p>Describes how the gene names relate to the query string.  E.g. <b>Contains</b> means that all gene names that contain the query string will be returned.</p>
</li> 
<li>
<a id="query_string"></a><br /> 
<b>Query String</b> 
<p>Used in conjunction with the search type to find matching gene names.</p>
</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Common Parameters</h3>

<a id="distance_lower_limit"></a><br /> 
<b>Distance Lower Limit</b> 
<p>Optional.  Enter a number between 0.0 and 19.0, (and not greater than Distance Upper Limit if one was entered).  Orthologs with a distance value (as calculated by the RSD algorithm) LESS than this limit will not be returned.  If left blank, ortholog results will not be limited.</p>

<li> 
<p><a id="divergence"></a><br /> 
<b>Divergence</b></p>
